# PhxOJ Site

A modern open-source online judge ,contest and teaching platform system.

The full name of PhxOJ is Phoenix Online Judge. Phoenix is taken from the emblem of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

This project is adapted from [DMOJ](https://github.com/DMOJ/online-judge) and inspired by [SchOJ](https://github.com/SchOJ).

## History

The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen has offered several UG and PG courses (e.g., CSC1001, CSC1003, CSC3002, CSC3100, and DDA6050) to teach student’s programming skills and over 1,000 students will select these courses each year. In the assignments of these courses, students are often asked to solve some problems by writing programs. Most of the programming assignments are often manually graded by teaching assistants (TAs), which not only involves huge amount of labor work, but also give little comprehensive feedback or opportunities for students to correct their mistakes since TAs only provide scores. 

To address the above issues and foster coding practice, we initiated an online system by borrowing an open-source tool for automatically grading programs in 2018, which is called [SchOJ](https://github.com/SchOJ). This system will be widely used in teaching by 2022. We have received very positive feedback from both students and professors, since it significantly reduces TAs’ workload. Moreover, it gives students much feedback/hints when the submitted programs cannot give correct answers, so the students know how to improve the codes, thereby enhancing the practice. 

Due to the fact that the senior who was mainly responsible for the development of SchOJ went abroad for futher study. As the current SchOJ administrator and a undergraduater who has participated in some improvements to SchOJ, I have decided to fork it from the latest DMOJ branch and make improvements to better meet teaching needs. The new OJ is named PhxOJ and will be developed starting from the summer of 2023.
